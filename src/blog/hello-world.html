  <h3>Welcome to my blog!</h3>
  <p>
    I've stripped it away to the bare minimum. No frameworks other than a small
    templating system I cooked up for this site specifically. I hope to keep
    this chill and expand it over time.

    I'm testing some markdown. 
    Hopefully I can do a numbered list: 
    1. foo 
    2. bar
    3. 4 
    
    or maybe even 
    * one 
    * two 
    * three 
    
    or even

    ```html
    <div>foo bar <br></div>
    ```

    ```python
    def main(foo: bar):
      pass
    ```
  </md>
