        I thought it would be appropriate to start this blog off by writing a bit about what powers it. It lives on Github Pages ([you can find all of this site there](https://github.com/shminge/shminge.dev)), but if you do some snooping around in the code you'll find some very strange looking `html` files. For example, this page you're on right now is the product of the following source page:

        ```html
        <page​layout>
            <m​d>
                <!-- markdown stuff -->
            </m​d>
        </page​layout>
        ```

        Anyone familiar with `html` will know that those tags don't exist. So how is this site working?

        ### Enter `builder.py`.
