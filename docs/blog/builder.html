                I thought it would be appropriate to start this blog off by
                writing a bit about what powers it. It lives on Github Pages (<a
                  href="https://github.com/shminge/shminge.dev"
                  >you can find all of this site there</a
                >), but if you do some snooping around in the code you'll find
                some very strange looking <code>html</code> files. For example,
                this page you're on right now is the product of the
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/shminge/shminge.dev/blob/main/src/blog/builder.html"
                  >following source page</a
                >:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;pagelayout&gt;
    &lt;md&gt;
        &lt;!-- markdown stuff --&gt;
    &lt;/md&gt;
&lt;/pagelayout&gt;
</code></pre>
              <p>
                Anyone familiar with <code>html</code> will know that those tags
                don't exist. So how is this site working?
              </p>
              <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>
              <p>
                I've always wanted to host a site over the years, so I've tried
                many of the options there are out there, and found them all
                lacking in one way or another. Some of my favourites were:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    ><a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a> -</strong
                  >
                  I love this one so much, but its simplicity is also its
                  drawback, as I can't do everything I want to do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    ><a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz</a> -</strong
                  >
                  This one was very attractive, as I store as much stuff as I
                  can in a large
                  <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> vault (this post
                  is being written in it right now), but as nice as it would be
                  to be able to publish straight out of it, it'd take a really
                  good understanding of the codebase before I could customise it
                  to the degree I wanted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    ><a href="https://nextjs.org/">React + Next.js</a> -</strong
                  >
                  This one almost stuck (this current site is a port of that
                  attempt to plain <code>html</code>), I just didn't like how
                  bloated it felt for what I wanted out of it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Being able to play with different platforms felt good and fun,
                but ultimately it wasn't moving me any closer to
                <em>actually having a blog with content</em>. It allowed me to
                feel productive without doing anything. So a week ago I set out
                to go and make my own site engine.
              </p>
              <h3>Requirements</h3>
              <p>
                I had a decently good idea of what I wanted from any possible
                solution:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Web Components</strong> - I liked using components in
                  React. I didn't use them for any sort of reactivity (hence the
                  feeling of bloat), but it was really nice to be able to define
                  something I could reuse again and again, especially if I could
                  pass it props. I know that &quot;official&quot; Web Components
                  exist, but I decided I didn't like them enough to use them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>MathJax</strong> - I like maths. It's only a matter of
                  time until I start writing posts which need formulas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Markdown Posts</strong> - This was more optional than
                  the others, but I love markdown as a format.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Simplicity</strong> - This is crucial. Not only do I
                  want full control, I want full understanding as well. The less
                  I understand something, the harder it is to use, and the less
                  I want to use it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I ended up deciding to write in plain <code>HTML</code>,
                <code>CSS</code>, and <code>js</code>. However, anyone who's
                written <code>html</code> by hand before knows it can be a pain,
                so I wrote my own build script (which supports all of those
                criteria above):
                <a href="https://github.com/shminge/builder"
                  >builder: a small python build script to populate html
                  templates</a
                >.
              </p>
              <h3>What does it do?</h3>
              <p>
                As of now (development is ongoing, and it'll presumably remain
                that way as long as I keep working on that site), it lets you do
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Define, use and render templates -</strong> For
                  example, the <code>&lt;pagelayout&gt;</code> block above is
                  simply a wrapper for the rest of my site (header and such),
                  and puts whatever is inside it in the
                  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Render Markdown -</strong> With a bit of help from the
                  <code>markdown-it-py</code> library, all text between
                  <code>&lt;md&gt;</code> tags gets converted from Markdown to
                  HTML at build time, letting me write in markdown and paste
                  into my <code>html</code> after.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Generate an RSS Feed -</strong> generate a feed of
                  whatever posts you want, wherever you want. This site has one
                  <a href="/feed.xml">here</a>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Finally, I have a system I where I can balance writing posts
                with writing code for the site, and both are equally enjoyable.
                A system that I completely understand, and don't have to spend
                hours reading docs to do anything mildly complicated. A system
                that won't lock me in, or break unexpectedly, or randomly be
                deprecated. A system that is built for me, by me.
              </p>
              <p>
                It'll always take more effort to make something yourself, but
                it'll always be more rewarding when you can see the end product,
                and know that you wrote <em>every line</em> of it.
